                        A little bit about me...
                  </h1>
                  <p> I am currently an HVAC technician in Southern California. Although, the industry offers many
                        opportunities I've never felt fulfilled. It wasn't until I had extra time to think about other
                        careers that I stumbled upon web development. After doing a bit of research I decided to try out
                        a course I found on Udemy by Colt Steele. The critical thinking and challenges that web
                        developemnt brings is exactly what I was looking for in a new career. I love learning new things
                        and with web development the learning seems endless.
                  </p>
                  <p> For the last few months I have been studying and experimenting as much as I can on my free time to
                        learn as much as possible about the front end. I finally feel confident and ready to start
                        applying for web development positions. My main goal for 2021 is to get my first front end
                        position job and also learn the skills needed to become a full stack engineer.</p>
